<p>Thank you for your interest in buying our wholesale soap. To order our wholesale soap, please email us at <a href="mailto:simplyshawneesoap@gmail.com">simplyshawneesoap@gmail.com</a>. or complete our Contact Us Form. Most questions can be answered quickly via email.</p>

<p>Our minimum order is $100.&nbsp; Shipping charges for wholesale soap orders are actual shipping costs, plus insurance and/or tracking charges. Please note that the maximum $7.00 shipping charge on the retail site is for retail orders only.</p>

<p><strong><u>To Place an Order:</u></strong>&nbsp;Send us a jpg or pdf of your Resale License information via email. We are required by Missouri law to have your resale license information on file. If you reside in a state that does not require businesses to have a tax ID number, please provide a statement of this fact on your business stationery so we have this on file for you.</p>

<p><strong><u>Payment Terms:</u></strong>&nbsp;We accept pre-payment by business check, money order, VISA, MasterCard, Discover, Paypal and American Express. Payment terms are available to governmental and non-profit groups with orders submitted to us in writing, and that contain appropriate authorizing signature(s).</p>

<p><strong><u>Return Policy:</u></strong>&nbsp;Due to the fact that all orders are custom cut and wrapped for you, and the very nature of the soap products we sell, we cannot accept returns. If we ship something incorrectly to you, of course these items should be returned to us, and at our cost. We recommend that you buy small amounts of a fragrance or soap variety when you buy our soap for the first time so that you confirm that it is what you want, and what you want to sell.</p>

<p>Any questions not covered here, please feel free to ask!</p>
